      "description": "Familie und Schule gelten als wesentliche Sozialisationsorte für Kinder. Die Verhältnisse zwischen diesen Sphären sind (z.B. in Bezug auf Interessen oder Funktionen) indes komplexer als gängige schematische Unterscheidungen etwa zwischen primärer und sekundärer Sozialisation nahelegen. Für die Gegenwart und jüngere Vergangenheit wird in diesem Kontext ein Wandel beschrieben, bei dem ein gesellschaftlich dominantes Kindheitsmuster der ‚Familienkindheit‘ abgelöst wird durch das einer ‚Bildungskindheit‘. Im Seminar werden Rahmenbedingungen und Formen dieses Wandels thematisiert. Zudem wird diskutiert, welche pädagogischen Probleme und Aufgaben sich dabei stellen. Das Seminar ist dem Modul Berufsfeld Grundschule zugeordnet.",
      "description_translated": "Family and school are regarded as essential places of socialisation for children. The relationships between these spheres (e.g. with regard to interests or functions) are, however, more complex than common schematic distinctions, such as between primary and secondary socialization, suggest. For the present and more recent past, a change is described in this context in which a socially dominant childhood pattern of 'family childhood' is replaced by that of 'educational childhood'. The seminar will focus on the framework conditions and forms of this change. In addition, it will be discussed which pedagogical problems and tasks arise. The seminar is assigned to the module Vocational Field Primary School.",

Odrasli se spoštovanja otroštva šele učimo in to je težka naloga. Druga tema je pogovor ali kot jaz pravim, soustvarjanje pogovora, ki omogoči, da ubesedimo življenje na način, da besede postanejo krplje, ki nam pomagajo, da ga živimo. Za svetlikanje potrebujemo čas, zato bo čas in v času ravnanje s sedanjostjo naša tretja tema. Spoštovanje otroštva, pogovor in čas bomo povezali v celoto. Govorila bom o soustvarjanju svetlikanja v družini. Govorila bom o starših, ki zmorejo biti spoštljivi in odgovorni zavezniki otrok, na način, da se jim znajo pridružiti kot ekspertom iz izkušenj. Zaključila bom z besedami o soustvarjanju v svetu za soustvarjanje sveta, ki bo od vseh.",

          "description": "This course explores the properties of non-sequential, multi-linear, and interactive forms of narratives as they have evolved from print to digital media. Works covered in this course range from the Talmud, classics of non-linear novels, experimental literature, early sound and film experiments to recent multi-linear and interactive films and games. The study of the structural properties of narratives that experiment with digression, multiple points of view, disruptions of time, space, and of storyline is complemented by theoretical texts about authorship/readership, plot/story, properties of digital media and hypertext. Questions that will be addressed in this course include: How can we define &#8216;non-sequentiality/multi-linearity&#8217;, &#8216;interactivity&#8217;, &#8216;narrative&#8217;. To what extend are these aspects determined by the text, the reader, the digital format? What are the roles of the reader and the author? What kinds of narratives are especially suited for a non-linear/interactive format? Are there stories that can only be told in a digital format? What can we learn from early non-digital examples of non-linear and interactive story telling?",

          "description": "In her final lecture of the course, Professor Hungerford evaluates Jonathan Safran Foer's Everything is Illuminated with respect to one of her areas of expertise, American writing about the Holocaust. She points out how the novel takes on some of the questions of trauma theory in its examination of both the pain and the healing power of repetition. The most innovative characteristic of Foer's novel is, for Hungerford, the way it addresses the inheritance of the Holocaust for third-generation Jews in America. The novel finds new ways to provide witness for and connection to their grandparents' experiences in Europe, but also displaces a traditional Holocaust discovery narrative from the Jewish child of survivors to the Eastern European grandchild of those complicit in the destruction of shtetl life.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reading assignment:**\r\n\r\nJonathan Safran Foer, Everything is Illuminated (2002)\r\n",

It rests on the observation\r\nthat those whose conduct is ethically positive are happier and more satisfied and the belief\r\nthat much of the unhappiness we humans endure is actually of our own making. Its\r\nultimate goal is happiness for every individual, irrespective of religious belief.\r\nThough the Dalai Lama is himself a practicing Buddhist, his approach to life and the moral\r\ncompass that guides him can be of use to each and every one of us – Muslim, Christian,\r\nJew, Buddhist or atheist – in our quest to lead a happier, more fulfilling life.\r\nAccording to the Dalai Lama our survival has depended and will continue to depend on our\r\nbasic goodness as human beings. In the past, the respect people had for their religion\r\nhelped maintain ethical practice through a majority following one religion or another.\r\nToday, with the growing secularization and globalization of society, we must find a way\r\nthat transcends religion to establish consensus as to what constitutes positive and negative\r\nconduct, what is right and wrong and what is appropriate and inappropriate.\r\n\r\nLink to [[http://www.dalailama.com/| The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama]]\\\\\r\nLink to [[http://www.dalailamafoundation.org/dlf/en/index.jsp| The Dalai Lama Foundation]]",

          "description": "Professor Gendler introduces Aristotle’s conception of virtue as a structuring one’s life so that one’s instinctive responses line up with one’s reflective commitments. Becoming virtuous, according to Aristotle, requires that we engage in a process of habituation by acting as if we were virtuous, just as musicians master their instruments by playing them. By contrast, when one’s behavior or experience is out of line with one’s reflective commitments, dissonance ensues. Exemplifying this dissonance are Vietnam veterans with PTSD, whose experiences author Jonathan Shay relates to those of the Greek soldiers in the Iliad. In both cases, the reflective commitment to “what’s right”, or themis, is betrayed by some commanding officers; the consequence is a loss of the possibility of social trust.",

By drawing on live and historical cases, especially from South Asia, Africa, Latin America as well as Eastern Europe, China, and other developing regions, we seek to cover the broad spectrum of challenges and opportunities facing developmental entrepreneurs. Finally, we explore a range of established and emerging business models as well as new business opportunities enabled by developmental technologies developed in MIT labs and beyond.",

It investigates the complex nature of 'successful' urban design and attempts to identify and evaluate examples of urban design that are at the leading edge of practice, anticipating the future. The seminar will deal with two parallel questions: what are the key trends that will shape the future form and function of cities, and how will these changes affect the role of the urban designer? The first part of the seminar focuses on the present, and the second part of the semester will consider the future. After the course surveys the landscape of contemporary urban design practice, the challenge it will pose to students will be to identify the trajectory of cities and city design from both physical and social perspectives.",

Ravno se naučite nekaj, za kar ste prepričani, da bo delovalo, a se že v naslednji situaciji znajdete, ne samo brez pomoči, včasih izgleda kot da bi se morali odzvati ravno obratno: recimo, ugotovite, da z očetom veliko lažje rešite konflikt, če mu pustite nekaj časa, da razmisli, vendar, ko poskusite tehniko uporabiti pri enem od prijateljev, ugotovite, da si vaše ravnanje razlaga kot da vam ni mar? Take in podobne situacije vam bo s pomočjo Teorije zavedanja odnosov in bogate prakse osvetlila Janja Rebolj, ki zase pravi, da je s Teorijo zavedanja odnosov srečala teorijo, ki se ji je ni bilo treba naučiti, temveč je le-ta opisoval življenje kot ga doživlja sama in kot se z njo strinja množica moderatorjev ki jih je usposobila za delo s teorijo zavedanja odnosov in njenimi orodji",

      "description": "This series of lectures presents the concluding part of the literary and cultural history of the United States from colonial times until today. It will start with the development of modernism in the arts around 1900, covering the new trends and experiments in poetry, drama and prose in the 1920s, the awakening of a new African American self-awareness and aesthetics during the Harlem Renaissance, the development of the novel up to WWII and into the Cold War, and finally, discussing the new forms of social protest, public art, ethnic and minority cultures and literatures, connected to the emergence of a 'postmodern' culture in the 1960s. The series will end with a discussion of most recent trends and developments in contemporary American literature and culture.",

          "title": "At the Limit: Violence in Contemporary Representation",
          "description": "This course focuses on novels and films from the last twenty-five years (nominally 1985&ndash;2010) marked by their relationship to extreme violence and transgression. Our texts will focus on serial killers, torture, rape, and brutality, but they also explore notions of American history, gender and sexuality, and reality television&mdash;sometimes, they delve into love or time or the redemptive role of art in late modernity. Our works are a motley assortment, with origins in the U.S., France, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Japan and South Korea. The broad global era marked by this period is one of acceleration, fragmentation, and late capitalism; however, we will also consider national specificities of violent representation, including particulars like the history of racism in the United States, the role of politeness in bourgeois Austrian culture, and the effect of Japanese manga on vividly graphic contemporary Asian cinema. We will explore the politics and aesthetics of the extreme; affective questions about sensation, fear, disgust, and shock; and problems of torture, pain, and the unrepresentable. We will ask whether these texts help us understand violence, or whether they frame violence as something that resists comprehension; we will consider whether form mitigates or colludes with violence. Finally, we will continually press on the central term in the title of this course: what, specifically, is violence? (Can we only speak of plural &quot;violences&quot;?) Is violence the same as force? Do we know violence when we see it? Is it something knowable or does it resist or even destroy knowledge? Is violence a matter for a text's content&mdash;who does what, how, and to whom&mdash;or is it a problem of form: shock, boredom, repetition, indeterminacy, blankness? Can we speak of an aesthetic of violence? A politics or ethics of violence? Note the question that titles our last week: Is it the case that we are what we see? If so, what does our obsession with ultraviolence mean, and how does contemporary representation turn an accusing gaze back at us?",

We will assess cultural traditions that challenge scientific interpretations of experience arising from western philosophical and physiological models. The class will examine how sensory experience lies beyond the realm of individual physiological or psychological responses and occurs within a culturally elaborated field of social relations. Finally, we will debate how discourse about the senses is a product of particular modes of knowledge production that are themselves contested fields of power relations.",

          "description": "In presenting the role and the meaning of Morphological content I will use this conception as Horgan and Potrč have put it in their recent work, concerning the formulation of belief fixation as it is approached in cognitive sciences. Through a brief inquiry into the structure of human cognition which has an Architecture that is essentially morphological, I will try to explain, why is this aspect of cognition plausible and what are the main things through which the morphological structure of cognition is expressed. It will be important to realize, that the process of belief formation is not entirely dependent of information that gets explicitly represented in consciousness during processing, but is specially grounded in the relevant background information that is called morphological content. As we will see, morphological content should be understood as a fundamental part of cognition, which is implicit in its structure and is automatically employed when the process of fixation of epistemically justified beliefs occurs. Also we will notice that the presence of the role of morphological content during belief formation is not totally unconscious, but is rather not explicitly presented, what will be shown with the possible expressions of morphological content being employed in the moment of belief fixation.",

          "description": "This course is one of many&nbsp;Advanced Undergraduate Seminars offered by the Biology Department at MIT. These seminars are tailored for students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current biological research in a highly interactive setting. This seminar provides a deeper understanding of the post-translational mechanisms evolved by eukaryotic cells to target proteins for degradation. Students learn how proteins are recognized and degraded by specific machinery (the proteasome) through their previous tagging with another small protein, ubiquitin. Additional topics include principles of ubiquitin-proteasome function, its control of the most important cellular pathways, and the implication of this system in different human diseases. Finally, speculation on the novel techniques that arose from an increased knowledge of the ubiquitin-proteosome system and current applications in the design of new pharmacological agents to battle disease is also covered.",

From the time of the Prophet Muhammad, Islam in its various manifestations has had a complex relationship with media. While much contemporary writing focuses on Islam in the media, this course explores how many aspects of Islamic practice and thinking might be understood as media technologies that facilitate the inscription, storage and transmission of knowledge. Central questions include: How do Islam and media technologies relate? What kinds of practices of inscription and transmission characterize Islam in all its varieties across time and place? How might Islamic thought and practice be understood in light of databases, networks, and audiovisual sensation? Given the rich diversity in Islam historically and geographically, emphasis will be placed on these interconnected but divergent practices from the earliest revelations of the Qur'an to contemporary Islamist political movements, with geographies spanning from Indonesia to the Middle East and North Africa, as well as in Europe and North America. In addition to exploring these themes through reading and writing, students will be encouraged to complete course assignments and projects in media, using audiovisual documentary or composition as a means of responding to the course themes.",

Die Betrachtung von Ökozonen stellt die linienhafte Abgrenzung von Klimazonen in Frage und nimmt auch die in geologischen Zeiträumen entstandenen Oberflächenformen, die keineswegs immer mit heutigen klimatischen Bedingungen korrespondieren müssen, in die Diskussion auf. Inhalt: Unter dem Begriff 'Ökozonen' werden Großräume der Erde zusammengefasst, die sich durch eine jeweils eigenständige Klimagenese, Lebensweise von Pflanzen und Tieren, Morphodynamik, Boden-bildungsprozesse sowie agrarische oder forstliche Produktionsleistungen auszeichnen. Sie unterscheiden sich z.B. nach dem jährlichen oder täglichen Klimagang, der Hydrologie (z.B. Abflussdynamik), den exogenen Landformen, den Pflanzenformationen und nicht zuletzt auch nach agrarisch-forstlichen Nutzungssystemen. Umweltprobleme, die sich in den einzelnen Zonen häufig durch eine zu hohe Landnutzungsintensität bzw. an die jeweiligen ökologischen Bedingungen vor Ort unangepasste Bewirtschaftungsart und –intensität ergeben, werden zumindest exemplarisch jeweils ebenfalls behandelt.

      "description_translated": "Objectives of the lecture: In this course, the participants work on the characteristics of the individual eco-zones of the earth and develop an order pattern of the earth in the global dimension. In addition to the qualitative representation of individual characteristics and characteristic complexes, the quantitative recording of material and energy reserves also plays a role. The consideration of ecological zones questions the linear delimitation of climate zones and also includes in the discussion the surface forms that have emerged in geological periods, which by no means always have to correspond with today's climatic conditions. Content: The term ecological zones is used to describe large areas of the earth which are characterised by an independent climatic genesis, the way of life of plants and animals, morphodynamics, soil formation processes as well as agricultural or forestry production services. They differ, for example, according to the annual or daily course of climate, hydrology (e.g. runoff dynamics), exogenous land forms, plant formations and, last but not least, agricultural-forestry use systems. Environmental problems that frequently arise in the individual zones as a result of excessive land use intensity or management methods and intensities that are not adapted to the respective ecological conditions on site are also dealt with, at least by way of example.

          "title": "Urban Ecology - Why Is It an Increasingly Important Topic? / Urbana ekologija – zakaj se njen pomen povečuje?",
          "description": "Land-use changes due rapidly increasing urbanization pose major threat on ecosystems and their functions worldwide. By the end of this decade, more than half of the world human population will be living in cities and other urbanized areas. Human-induced habitats, loss and fragmentation of the landscape as well as accumulation of trace gases and other pollutants serve as the best-known examples of negative impacts of dense human population on the surrounding environment. Land-use changes can be seen analogous to soil use, as well-developed old soils are replaced by functionally altered soils or even by completely new substrates, called “made lands”.  Such conversion of land and soils to urban use is likely to translate into changes in soil biota, thereby distorting life-supporting ecosystem services, such as decomposition of organic matter, cycling of nutrients and detoxification of harmful substances. Urban soils are traditionally described as being highly artificial and disturbed, although soils in urban parks and gardens can share many features typical to agricultural, even natural soils. One of the key factors distinguishing urban soils from natural soils is their high spatial heterogeneity in the various ecological patterns and processes. This high heterogeneity manifests as parks, cemeteries, vacant lots, streams and lakes, gardens and yards, campus areas, golf courses, bridges, air ports and landfills. These habitats are highly dynamic, influenced by both biophysical and ecological drivers on the one hand and social and economic drivers on the other. Active management of green spaces is vital but seldom sufficient, there is also a need to protect, restore and manage surrounding ecosystems in order to maintain ecosystem services of value for human well-being and build resilience in the urban landscape. \r\nRecent climate models predict precipitation to increase under various climatic conditions, especially in heavily urbanized areas. Combined with increasing proportion of sealed, impermeable surfaces in urban settings, the growing trend of rain events are likely to cause anomalies in hydrological cycles. A typical example of it is the increased quantity and worsened quality of urban runoff waters (“street waters”). In this presentation urban runoff waters will be dealt as an indicator of the ecological health of urbanized habitats. Furthermore, the typicalities of urban vs. natural ecosystems are compared  and some examples of the ongoing urban ecological studies in Finland will be presented.\r\n----\r\nZaradi hitro naraščajoče urbanizacije prihaja do sprememb v rabi zemljišč, kar predstavlja\r\npomembno grožnjo ekosistemom in njihovemu delovanju širom po svetu. Do konca tega desetletja bo\r\nveč kot polovica svetovne populacije živela v mestih in drugih urbaniziranih območjih. Habitati, ki jih\r\nspreminja človek, izguba in fragmentacija pokrajine kot tudi sproščanje plinov v sledovih in drugih\r\nonesnaževalcev služijo kot najbolj znani primeri negativnih vplivov goste človeške populacije na\r\nokolje. Spremembe v rabi zemljišč lahko gledamo kot izrabo tal, ko se dobro razvita stara prst\r\nnadomešča s funkcionalno spremenjeno prstjo ali celo s povsem novim substratom, tako imenovano\r\n\"umetno zemljo\". Takšno spreminjanje zemljišč za potrebe urbane uporabe najverjetneje vodi v\r\nspremembe v življenju v prsti in tako poruši življenjske podporne mehanizme ekosistema, kot so\r\nrazgradnja organskih snovi, kroženje hranil in razstrupljanje škodljivih snovi. Zemljo v urbanih\r\nobmočjih po navadi opisujejo kot umetno in močno prizadeto, vendar pa je prst v mestnih parkih in\r\nvrtovih lahko zelo podobna kmetijski ali celo naravni prsti. Eden glavnih dejavnikov, po katerih se\r\nzemlja v mestih loči od tiste v naravi zunaj mest, je velika prostorska heterogenost različnih ekoloških\r\nvzorcev in procesov. Visoko heterogenost kažejo okolja kot so parki, pokopališča, gradbišča, potoki in\r\njezera, vrtovi in dvorišča, univerzitetna naselja, igrišča za golf, mostovi, letališča in smetišča. Ti\r\nhabitati so zelo dinamični, nanje po eni strani vplivajo biofizikalni in ekološki dejavniki, po drugi\r\nstrani pa socialne in ekonomske težnje. Aktivno upravljanje zelenih prostorov je zelo pomembno,\r\nvendar redko zadostuje; treba je ščititi, obnavljati in upravljati tudi okolišnje ekosisteme, zato da se\r\nvzdržujejo podporne storitve v ekosistemih, ki so pomembne za blagostanje ljudi in omogočajo\r\nprožnost urbane krajine.\r\nZadnji klimatski modeli napovedujejo povečanje količine padavin v različnih klimatskih pogojih, še\r\nposebno v močno urbaniziranih območjih. V povezavi z vedno večjim deležem zatesnjenih,\r\nneprepustnih površin v urbanih okoljih je zelo verjetno, da bo naraščajoči trend dežja povzročil\r\nanomalije v hidroloških ciklih. Tipični primer tega je povečana količina in poslabšana kakovost\r\nurbanih površinsko odtekajočih voda (\"ulične vode\"). V tej predstavitvi bodo urbane odtočne vode\r\nuporabljene kot kazalnik ekološkega zdravja urbanih življenjskih okolij. Nadalje bodo predstavljeni\r\nprimerjava značilnosti urbanih in naravnih ekosistemov ter nekaj primerov potekajočih urbanih\r\nekoloških študij na Finskem.",

          "description": "Today many people assume that technological change is the major factor in historical change and that it tends to lead to historical progress. This class turns these assumptions into a question—what is the role of technology in history?—by focusing on four key historical transitions: the human revolution (the emergence of humans as a history-making species), the Neolithic Revolution (the emergence of agriculture-based civilizations); the great leap in productivity (also known as the industrial revolution), and the great acceleration that has come with the rise of human empire on the planet. These topics are studied through a mix of textbook reading (David Christian's \"Maps of Time\"), supplementary readings (ranging from Auel, \"The Clan of the Cave Bear\" to Hersey, \"Hiroshima\"), illustrated lectures, class discussions, guest lectures/discussions, short \"problem paper\" assignments, and a final project defined by the student.\r\nBecause MIT is celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2011, this version of the class will also focus on connections between MIT as an institution and technology in the history of the last 150 years.",

Digitization and various forms of electronic media, some critics say, are rendering the printed text as obsolete as the writing quill. In this subject, we will examine the claims for and against the demise of the book, but we will also supplement these arguments with an historical perspective they lack: we will examine texts, printing technologies, and reading communities from roughly 1450 to the present. We will begin with the theoretical and historical overviews of Walter Ong and Elizabeth Eisenstein, after which we will study specific cases such as English chapbooks, Inkan knotted and dyed strings, late nineteenth-century recording devices, and newspapers online today. We will also visit a rare book library and make a poster on a hand-set printing press.",

Surveying the field chronologically across the major narrative genres and sub-genres from Homeric epic through the novel and across media to include live performance, film, and video games, we will be examining the ways in which new ideologies and psychological insights become available through the development of various narrative techniques and new technologies. Emphasis will be placed on the generic conventions of story-telling as well as on literary and cultural issues, the role of media and modes of transmission, the artistic significance of the chosen texts and their identity as anthropological artifacts whose conventions and assumptions are rooted in particular times, places, and technologies. Authors will include: Homer, Sophocles, Herodotus, Christian evangelists, Marie de France, Cervantes, La Clos, Poe, Lang, Cocteau, Disney-Pixar, and Maxis-Electronic Arts, with theoretical readings in Propp, Bakhtin, Girard, Freud, and Marx.",

The Fourteenth Dalai Lama has considered this question and would like to share his thoughts in the hope that they may be of direct, practical benefit to those who read them.\r\n \r\n\"I believe that the purpose of life is to be happy. From the moment of birth, every human being wants happiness and does not want suffering.  Neither social conditioning nor education nor ideology affect this.  From the very core of our being, we simply desire contentment.  I don't know whether the universe, with its countless galaxies, stars and planets, has a deeper meaning or not, but at the very least, it is clear that we humans who live on this earth face the task of making a happy life for ourselves.  Therefore, it is important to discover what will bring about the greatest degree of happiness.\"",

          "title": "Can matrix coherence be efficiently and accurately estimated?",
          "description": "Matrix coherence has recently been used to\r\ncharacterize the ability to extract global information\r\nfrom a subset of matrix entries in\r\nthe context of low-rank approximations and\r\nother sampling-based algorithms. The significance\r\nof these results crucially hinges upon\r\nthe possibility of efficiently and accurately\r\ntesting this coherence assumption. This paper\r\nprecisely addresses this issue. We introduce\r\na novel sampling-based algorithm for estimating\r\ncoherence, present associated estimation\r\nguarantees and report the results of\r\nextensive experiments for coherence estimation.\r\nThe quality of the estimation guarantees\r\nwe present depends on the coherence\r\nvalue to estimate itself, but this turns\r\nout to be an inherent property of samplingbased\r\ncoherence estimation, as shown by our\r\nlower bound. In practice, however, we find\r\nthat these theoretically unfavorable scenarios\r\nrarely appear, as our algorithm efficiently\r\nand accurately estimates coherence across a\r\nwide range of datasets, and these estimates\r\nare excellent predictors of the effectiveness of\r\nsampling-based matrix approximation on a\r\ncase-by-case basis. These results are significant\r\nas they reveal the extent to which coherence\r\nassumptions made in a number of recent\r\nmachine learning publications are testable.",

          "description": "Cross-lingual representations of linguistic units (e.g., words or phrases) can facilitate transfer of annotation from resource-rich to resource-poor languages and have many potential multilingual applications (e.g., machine translation and crosslingual information retrieval). In this talk, I will discuss our ongoing work which aims to induce cross-lingual representations relying primarily on monolingual unannotated texts readily available for many languages. From the learning standpoint, our approaches maximize the likelihood of monolingual unannotated texts but also use a form of regularization which favors agreement on a smaller collection of parallel data (i.e. sentences along with their translations). I will address the induction of different types of cross-lingual representations (clusters and distributed representations) for different types of units (words, phrases and predicateargument structures). We show that these models induce linguistically-plausible semantic representations and that cross-lingual induction both helps to induce better representations for individual languages and benefits various cross-lingual applications. Specifically, I will consider direct transfer of a classifier for a document classification task from one language to another, and show preliminary results in the context of low resource machine translation.",

      "description": "Die Französische Revolution zählt zu den zentralen Umbrüchen in der europäischen Geschichte und wird vielfach als Beginn der Moderne begriffen. Im Zeitraum zwischen 1789 und 1799 wurde die Monarchie zunächst in eine konstitutionelle Monarchie umgewandelt, diese dann im Zuge der Terreur gewaltsam abgeschafft und letztlich eine Republik gegründet. In der Direktorialzeit beruhigte sich die politische Situation, allerdings konnten sich die verschiedenen Direktorien nur mühsam gegenüber den nach sozialer Gleichheit strebenden Bevölkerungsschichten sowie monarchischen Restaurationsbewegungen behaupten. Zum entscheidenden Machtfaktor wurde dann das Bürgerheer, das nicht nur in den Revolutions- bzw. Koalitionskriegen kämpfte, sondern auch Napoleon zum Aufstieg verhalf. Diese Entwicklungen werden im Zentrum der Vorlesung stehen und aus unterschiedlichen Perspektiven beleuchtet. Es werden aber auch die Reaktionen auf die Französische Revolution sowie ihre Wirkungen in den Blick genommen.",
      "description_translated": "The French Revolution is one of the central upheavals in European history and is often regarded as the beginning of modernity. In the period between 1789 and 1799, the monarchy was first transformed into a constitutional monarchy, which was then violently abolished in the course of the Terreur, and finally a republic was founded. The political situation calmed down during the period of the directorate, but the various directorates were only able to assert themselves with difficulty against the population strata striving for social equality and the monarchic restoration movements. The decisive power factor then became the citizen army, which not only fought in the revolutionary and coalition wars, but also helped Napoleon to rise. These developments will be the focus of the lecture and will be examined from different perspectives. However, the reactions to the French Revolution and its effects will also be examined.",

It focuses on the theoretical, historiographic, and design approaches to architectural problems encountered in the age of industrial and post-industrial expansion across the globe, with specific attention to the dominance of European modernism in setting the agenda for the discourse of a global modernity at large. It explores modern architectural history through thematic exposition rather than as a simple chronological succession of ideas.",

      "description": "Sommersemester 2019 Helen Koriath Form als Norm? Gesellschaftliche Utopien und individuelle Wohnkonzepte Hauptseminar, Mastermodul 1 (Theorie und Methode) Do 10 – 12 (mit integrierten Workshops in Blöcken, in der zweiten Semesterhälfte auch an Freitagnachmittagen) Beginn: 04. 04. Kick-off, gemeinsam mit Antje Busch-Sperveslage und Jan Giebel Format, hat der Künstler Kurt Schwitters, der u. a. auch als Gestalter und Typograph gearbeitet hat, 1927 in einer niederländischen Zeitschrift geschrieben, sei ein neues Schlagwort für Architekten. Maler können Qualität haben, Architekten Format. Format bedeutet Qualität in der Anschauung. Da kann ein ganz kleines Ding oft Format haben. Seit Jahrzehnten schon wurde zu diesem Zeitpunkt in fortwährenden Auseinandersetzungen unterschiedlicher Lager um eine Ablösung der Formideale des 19. Jahrhunderts und um mögliche Wege dahin gerungen. In Deutschland spielte der 1907 von Künstlern, Architekten, industriellen und handwerklichen Unternehmen gegründete Deutsche Werkbund eine wichtige Rolle in diesen Fragen und setzte sich die Veredelung der gewerblichen Arbeit auch und gerade in der Serienfertigung und Massenproduktion als Ziel. Es wurden sogenannte Warenbücher herausgegeben, die den Verbrauchern Hilfestellung bei der Gestaltung ihrer häuslichen Umwelt ohne Plüsch und Plunder leisten wollten. Auch große Ausstellungen wurden organisiert, um für die Form ohne Ornament zu werben. Zwar ließen Arbeitslosigkeit und Weltwirtschaftskrise viele Träume schrumpfen oder platzen, dennoch waren die ersten Jahrzehnte des 20. Jahrhunderts von Normierungsgedanken und entsprechend vielen Neuerungen im Bauen und in der Gestaltung des modernen Lebens geprägt, die sich bis in die Gegenwart auswirken. Entscheidende Impulse gingen auch vom Bauhaus in seiner zweiten Phase in Dessau aus. Auch die Entwicklung der Bauhaustapete in Zusammenarbeit von Bauhaus und Tapetenfabrik (Gebr. Rasch und Co, Bramsche bei Osnabrück), die im Sommer Gegenstand einer Ausstellung im Osnabrücker Museumsquartier sein wird, hatte zum Ziel, einen qualitativ hohen Standard in der Innenausstattung von einfachen Siedlungshäusern und 'Volkswohnungen' zu garantieren.In dieser projektorientierten Lehrveranstaltung wird der Fokus auf Studien industriell und in Serie hergestellter Dinge gerichtet, auf Produkte, die eher in den Bereich von 'Volksbedarf statt Luxusbedarf' fallen und die Alltags- und insbesondere Wohnumgebung heute prägen, deren Geschichte oftmals nicht bekannt ist, weil sie als Massenprodukte von anonymer Herkunft sind, also kein Label über ihre Ursprünge Aufschluss gibt. Als Untersuchungsgegenstände sollen vor allem Dinge aus dem Wohn- und Arbeitsumfeld der Lehrveranstaltungsteilnehmer dienen. Das Hauptseminar steht in enger Verbindung mit dem Hauptseminar Strategien und Methoden der Objektinszenierung am Freitag sowie den Lehrveranstaltungen von Antje Busch-Sperveslage und Jan Giebel. Es ist geplant, Ergebnisse aus diesen Lehrveranstaltungen zu einer gemeinsamen Präsentation in Zusammenhang mit der Ausstellung bauhaustapete – neu aufgerollt zusammenzuführen. nLiteratur befindet sich im Semesterapparat zu diesem Seminar in der UB und in den Semesterapparaten der Lehrveranstaltungen zu Bauhaus-Themen von Frau Dr. Busch-Sperveslage und Jan Giebel.",

Social Utopias and Individual Living Concepts Hauptseminar, Master Module 1 (Theory and Method) Do 10 - 12 (with integrated workshops in blocks, in the second half of the semester also on Friday afternoons) Start: 04. 04. 04. Kick-off, together with Antje Busch-Sperveslage and Jan Giebel Format, the artist Kurt Schwitters, who has also worked as a designer and typographer, wrote in 1927 in a Dutch magazine, is a new catchword for architects. Painters can have quality, architects can have format. Format means quality in perception. A very small thing can often have format. For decades at this point in time, the continual arguments of different camps have been wrestling with the replacement of the formal ideals of the 19th century and with possible ways of achieving this. In Germany, the Deutscher Werkbund, founded in 1907 by artists, architects, industrial and craft enterprises, played an important role in these questions and set itself the goal of refining commercial work, especially in series production and mass production. So-called Warenbücher were published to help consumers design their home environment without plush and junk. Large exhibitions were also organised to promote the form without ornaments. Although unemployment and the world economic crisis caused many dreams to shrink or burst, the first decades of the 20th century were still marked by the idea of standardisation and correspondingly many innovations in construction and in the design of modern life, which have an effect to this day. The Bauhaus in its second phase in Dessau also provided decisive impetus. The development of Bauhaus wallpaper in cooperation between Bauhaus and Tapetenfabrik (Gebr. Rasch and Co, Bramsche near Osnabrück), which will be the subject of an exhibition in the Museumsquartier in Osnabrück this summer, also aimed to guarantee a high standard of quality in the interior design of simple residential buildings and people's apartments.In this project-oriented course, the focus will be on studies of industrial and mass-produced things, on products that fall more into the area of people's needs instead of luxury needs and shape the everyday and especially living environment today, whose history is often not known because they are mass products of anonymous origin, i.e. no label reveals their origins. The main objects of investigation will be things from the living and working environment of the course participants. The main seminar is closely connected with the main seminar Strategies and Methods of Object Staging on Friday as well as with the courses of Antje Busch-Sperveslage and Jan Giebel. It is planned to bring together the results of these courses in a joint presentation in connection with the exhibition bauhaus wallpaper - newly rolled up. nLiterature is in the semester apparatus for this seminar in the UB and in the semester apparatuses of the courses on Bauhaus topics by Dr. Busch-Sperveslage and Jan Giebel.",

Class participation is essential and will be factored into the final grade.The course will portray the history of theory neither as the history of architectural theory exclusively, nor as a series of prepackaged static pronouncements, but as part of a broader set of issues with an active history that must be continually probed and queried. The sequence of topics will not be absolutely predetermined, but some of the primary issues that will be addressed are: pedagogy, professionalism, nature, modernity and the Enlightenment. Classroom discussions and debates are intended to demonstrate differences of opinion and enhance awareness of the consequences that these differences had in specific historical contexts.",

          "description": "Touring exhibition Le Corbusier, first exhibition of a foreign architect in Yugoslavia after the Second\r\nWorld War, took place in five out of six capitals of Yugoslavian republics, Split, and Mostar, in the late\r\n1952 and first half of 1953. It was one of a series of cultural events and professional exchanges with\r\nWest that marked the first half of the 1950's. After a representative exhibition of Yugoslavian architecture\r\nin Rabat organised on the occasion of joining International Union of Architects (UIA), opportunity to sum\r\nup achievements of the first five-year plan and proof of existence of modernist discourse inherited from\r\ninterwar period, Le Corbusier's exhibition was supposed to indicate the direction of further development\r\nof urban planning and architecture liberated from classical International style spatial organisation and\r\ndesign. The exhibition was a dialogue initiated by Le Corbusier himself, a platform of topics and designs\r\nimportant for solving acute omnipresent problems – reconstruction and construction of cities, and\r\nhousing. By organising the exhibition after the short-lived episode of Soviet socialist realism Federal\r\nUnion of Associations of Yugoslav Architects confirmed its commitment to modernism as an official\r\narchitectural style of socialist Yugoslavia and Le Corbusier’s position of a leading foreign architect whose\r\nname was synonymous with Neues Bauen already in 1920’s. The leading Yugoslavian architects,\r\nnamely Nikola Dobrović, Juraj Neidhardt, and Edvard Ravnikar (the latter two worked at Le Corbusier’s\r\nstudio in 1930’s), supported the exhibition as well and contributed to its significance by delivering\r\nkeynote speeches and lectures. The presentation will examine the exhibition’s reception and its\r\nrelevance regarding other professional events of the first half of the 1950’s. By presenting exhibition\r\ncontent and series of comparative examples it will also indicated the scope of architectural and urban\r\nplanning production that it affected. \r\n",

          "description": "Graph theory is one of the most applicable fields of mathematics, outside mathematics it is in particular useful in chemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics and social sciences. The current hot topic of large networks is also based on graph theory. Graph theory is one of the most recognized and established areas of Slovene mathematics, the expression »Slovene graph theory school« became standard in the area. Among the numerous areas of graph theory and related fields we put special emphasize on topological graph theory,  structure graph theory, spectral graph theory, metric graph theory, graph products, graph colorings, graph algorithms, computational geometry, combinatorial optimization, Tower of Hanoi problems as well as applications of these areas. \r\n\r\n\tThe research group is composed from teams from the University of Ljubljana and the  University of Maribor, each having about one half of the members. The research programme is thus very important as it enables fruitful collaboration between the researchers from both universities. The programme in the present form was established in 2004 by merging the programme Graph products and metric graph theory consisting mostly of researchers from the University of Maribor and the programme Topological graph theory with members from the University of Ljubljana.\r\n\r\n\tOur excellence can be proved with top-level publications, numerous invited talks at conferences and universities as well as with our editorial work in central, even prestigious, journals from the area of graph theory and more generally discrete mathematics. Another important achievement are four books published by leading scientific publishers. The first two, »Product graphs: Structure and Recognition«, published in 2000 by Wiley-Interscience and »Graphs on Surfaces« from 2001, published by Johns Hopkins University Press, are among the most cited works of Slovenian mathematics. They were follows with two more books published in 2008 and 2011 with A K Peters and CRC Press, respectively. ",

We call this the Team Formation problem. We require that members of X not only meet the skill requirements of the task, but can also work effectively together as a team. We measure effectiveness using the communication cost incurred by the subgraph in G that only involves X. We study two variants of the problem for two different communication-cost functions, and show that both variants are NP-hard. We explore their connections with existing combinatorial problems and give novel algorithms for their solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to consider the Team Formation problem in the presence of a social network of individuals. Experiments on the DBLP dataset show that our framework works well in practice and gives useful and intuitive results.",

      "description": "**Please Note: This course is only open to master students in the following programs: -- English and American Studies -- Literatur und Kultur in Europa -- Kunst und Kommunikation Other master students have to speak with the instructor (Schneck, Meyer) about optional attendance in person. This applies only when slots are still available, priority will be given to students from the said programs.** Content: Humans have been telling multimedial stories since imagination exists, and thus defined, explained, and shaped reality. In the same way, art has always been affected by technology as an opportunity for experimenting and developing new tools. While the active participation of an audience isn't a new idea either, storytelling has taken on new forms of co-creating and interaction over the last years, which include and extend into virtual realities and the ever-louder call for 'making real'. With increasing social and environmental challenges facing the current and coming generations, innovative and participatory forms of storytelling have become even bigger assets in the fabrication of possible new realities, thus cross-pollinating different genres and fields, from biomimicry to museality. In the frame of the seminar, we investigate various forms of the telling and making of reality by artists, scientists, writers, tinkerers, players, designers, and more. The participants will be encouraged to investigate new perspectives, and find their own innovative ways of making reality. Expectations The interdisciplinary seminar is open to all students willing to engage in lively discussions and (artistic) research activities. A reading list will be provided before the seminar, the participants are expected to read the core texts and prepare the seminar through individual research tasks communicated in advance. Participation in all sessions is mandatory.",

Digitization and various forms of electronic media, some critics say, are rendering the printed text as obsolete as the writing quill. In this subject, we will examine the claims for and against the demise of the book, but we will also supplement these arguments with an historical perspective they lack: we will examine texts, printing technologies, and reading communities from roughly 1450 to the present. We will begin with the theoretical and historical overviews of Walter Ong and Elizabeth Eisenstein, after which we will study specific cases such as English chapbooks, Inkan knotted and dyed strings, late nineteenth-century recording devices, and newspapers online today. We will also visit a rare book library and make a poster on a hand-set printing press.",

We will then explore how different presentations in different media can complement and enhance our storytelling.  While we will read scholarly articles and discuss ideas about transmedia, this is primarily a class in making speculative fiction transmedia projects.

          "description": "Transmedia narratives exist across multiple storytelling platforms, using the advantages of each to enhance the experience of the audience.  No matter which medium nor how many, the heart of any successful transmedia project is a good story.  In this class we will spend time on the basics of solid storytelling in speculative fiction before we move on to how to translate those elements into various media.  We will then explore how different presentations in different media can complement and enhance our storytelling.  While we will read scholarly articles and discuss ideas about transmedia, this is primarily a class in making speculative fiction transmedia projects.  We will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various mediums and consider how they complement each other, and how by using several different media we can give the audience a more complete, rewarding, and immersive experience.",

          "description": "This course focuses on one particular aspect of the history of computing: the use of the computer as a scientific instrument. The electronic digital computer was invented to do science, and its applications range from physics to mathematics to biology to the humanities. What has been the impact of computing on the practice of science? Is the computer different from other scientific instruments? Is computer simulation a valid form of scientific experiment? Can computer models be viewed as surrogate theories? How does the computer change the way scientists approach the notions of proof, expertise, and discovery? No comprehensive history of scientific computing has yet been written. This seminar examines scientific articles, participants&#8217; memoirs, and works by historians, sociologists, and anthropologists of science to provide multiple perspectives on the use of computers in diverse fields of physical, biological, and social sciences and the humanities. We explore how the computer transformed scientific practice, and how the culture of computing was influenced, in turn, by scientific applications.",

          "description": "This paper presents project design and initial experiences of involving users and collaborating between disciplines within the newly started project Tilltal (Berg et al.). The long-term goal of the Tilltal project is to make speech data at the Swedish memory archives more accessible to SSH researchers. We achieve this not only by describing methods by which speech technology can be used to reach SSH research goals, but also by providing fruitful examples of involving users, studying usage and collaborating between disciplines using the approach of participatory design (e.g. Kensing & Blomberg 1998). We use activity theory to survey the research activi-ties surrounding the archival materials (e.g. Nardi 1996). We model characteristic situations of use following ideas in Hansen et al. 2014, propose language technology solutions and assess their usefulness in practice by means of use cases (Jacobson et al. 1992, 2011).",

Understanding the determinants and outcomes of spatial political patterns poses specific theoretical and methodological challenges. The seminar provides an applied introduction into methods and tools of political geography focusing on spatial dimensions of violent conflict, development and state-building at the subnational level. The first part of the seminar will introduce the broad themes and key concepts of political geography. The second part will provide a general overview and critical appraisal of various sources of spatial data. The third part of the course will focus on basic methods of visualization and analysis of spatial data in qualitative and quantitative research designs. The course will include a hands-on introduction into the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) using the open source software Quantum GIS (QGIS).",

          "description": "This class uses lab exercises and a workshop setting to help students develop a solid understanding of the planning and public management uses of geographic information systems (GIS). The goals are to help students: acquire technical skills in the use of GIS software; acquire qualitative methods skills in data and document gathering, analyzing information, and presenting results; and investigate the potential and practicality of GIS technologies in a typical planning setting and evaluate possible applications.\nThe workshop teaches GIS techniques and basic database management at a level that extends somewhat beyond the basic thematic mapping and data manipulation skills included in the MCP core classes (viz. 11.204 and 11.220). Instead of focusing on one thematic map of a single variable, students will concentrate on more open-ended planning questions that invite spatial analysis but will require judgment and exploration to select relevant data and mapping techniques; involve mixing and matching new, local data with extracts from official records (such as census data, parcel data and regional employment and population forecasts); utilize spatial analysis techniques such as buffering, address matching, overlays; use other modeling and visualization techniques beyond thematic mapping; and raise questions about the skills, strategy, and organizational support needed to sustain such analytic capability within a variety of local and regional planning settings.\nStudents seeking graduate credit should enroll in the subject 11.520; undergraduates should enroll in the subject 11.188.

          "description": "Geo-ontologies are becoming first-class artifacts in spatial data management because of their ability to represent places and points of interest. Several general-purpose geo-ontologies are available and widely employed to describe spatial entities across the world. The cultural, contextual and geographic differences between locations, however, call for more specialized and spatially-customized geo-ontologies. In order to help ontology engineers in (re)engineering geo-ontologies, spatial data analytics can provide interesting insights on territorial characteristics, thus revealing peculiarities and diversities between places.\r\nIn this paper we propose a set of spatial analytics methods and tools to evaluate existing instances of a general-purpose geo-ontology within two distinct urban environments, in order to support ontology engineers in two tasks: (1) the identification of possible location-specific ontology restructuring activities, like specializations or extensions, and (2) the specification of new potential concepts to formalize neighborhood semantic models. We apply the proposed approach to datasets related to the cities of Milano and London extracted from LinkedGeoData, we present the experimental results and we discuss their value to assist geo-ontology engineering.",

During the seminar we try to get an overview on the method portfolio we have in the IUSF. By collecting best practice examples for the use of particular methods, we are exploring possibilities to combine methods with one another and understand their respective limits. Getting to know, who uses which methods, and to share knowledge and experiences will hopefully lead to understand how the different methods link to each other in the bigger picture. The presentations will generally be recorded via OpenCast and are only accessible to registered participants. This course is adressed to all scientific staff members of the Institute of Environmental Systems Research. It is also open to advanced students who want to get more familiar with applied scientific methods used by members of the IUSF. No grade or credit points will be awarded.",

          "description": "The course applies molecular biology and reverse genetics approaches to the study of apoptosis, or programmed cell death (PCD), in Drosophila cells. RNA interference (RNAi), or double stranded RNA-mediated gene silencing, will be used to inhibit expression of candidate apoptosis-related genes in cultured Drosophila cells. Teams of 2 or 3 students will design and carry out experiments to address questions about the genes involved in the regulation and execution of PCD in this system. Some projects involve the use of DNA damaging agents or other cytotoxic chemicals or drugs to help understand the pathways that control a cell's decision to undergo apoptosis. Instruction and practice in written and oral communication are provided.",

She introduces the notion of an “involuntary foreigner” to discuss the fate of Hemingway’s American protagonist Robert Jordan, as well as the Spanish guerillas who are turned into “aliens” within their own country due to their print and technological illiteracies. Professor Dimock concludes by connecting one’s status as an involuntary foreigner to the shape of the future, arguing that these characters have a tenuous claim to a Spain dominated by the Fascists, and to a modernity increasingly dominated by technology.",

He starts by explaining the reasons why Don Quixote is a masterpiece and its place and relevance in the history of Western literature. He then comments on the proper pronunciation of the word \"Quixote\" and the reasons for the mispronunciations in French and English. A full explanation of the real title of the work (El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha) follows, along with some key clarifications about the language of the book and a few basic notes on historical and cultural background. González Echevarría then moves on to the present, commenting on Don Quixote's legacy in the Western world, proved by the use of words such as \"quixotic,\" and the success of its myth up to the present. He finishes his lecture by going back to its beginning, referring to the reasons for the endurance of this work, which relies on its deep questioning of the human self. The session ends with an overview of the syllabus.",

          "description": "How do kids manage to figure out that the word “dog” applies to a whole category of animals, not just one creature?  Joshua Tenenbaum wants to understand how children and adults manage to solve such classic problems of induction. Throughout cognition, wherever you look, he says “we see places where we know more than we have a reasonable right to know about the world, places where we come to abstractions, generalizations, models of the world that go beyond our sparse, noisy, limited experience.” Tenenbaum’s goal is to come up with “general purpose computational tools for understanding how people solve these problems so successfully.”\n\nHe’s creating a set of hierarchical, probabilistic models that will help explain how humans make inductive leaps – how abstract knowledge that “guides and constrains our inferences” helps us acquire language from our earliest days. While his models can apply to many areas of cognition, Tenenbaum focuses on recent work with syntax. From very simple data, children manage to turn a complex declarative like “The girl who is sleeping is happy,” to a complex interrogative: “Is the girl who is sleeping happy?” They don’t say, “Is the girl who sleeping is happy?” Tenenbaum suggests that humans somehow identify the hierarchical phrase structure of language, and use this as an “inductive constraint to guide acquisition of a particular piece of syntax.”\n\nTenenbaum and his colleagues have built representative grammars using data from child-directed speech --2300 sentences that correspond to 20 thousand-plus utterances. He deconstructs these sentences so that each word is replaced by a syntactic category. “The baby bear discovers Goldilocks in his bed” becomes “det adj n v prop pre adj n.” He’s explored these grammars for their capacity to balance complexity, generalize appropriately, and ability to fit the data. His results indicate that “by having the right kind of inductive bias, the idea of hierarchical phrase structure, you can make generalizations which you have no evidence for…”",

A universal Turing machine is one\r that can emulate (or imitate) any other Turing machine, and thus in a sense can\r undertake to compute any of a very large class of computable functions.
